## Methodology Used
Data Collection and Integration: Data was gathered from various sources and consolidated into a coherent dataset.
Data Cleaning and Transformation: The dataset was cleaned using Python to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted an in-depth analysis using statistical methods and visualization techniques to uncover trends and patterns in the data.
Visualization: Used Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visual representations of the data to aid in the analysis.
Insights and Recommendations: Derived insights from the analysis and provided recommendations to improve sales and operations.
Final Insights and Conclusion
Sales Consistency Across Stores: The total revenue generated across all stores is quite similar, indicating consistent sales performance across different locations.
Customer Purchase Behavior: Most transactions involve one or two items, presenting an opportunity to increase the number of items purchased per transaction through bundle discounts and loyalty rewards.
Product Popularity: Coffee is the most popular category, followed by tea and bakery items, suggesting a strong customer preference for these products.
Pricing and Sales Volume: Higher-priced items such as loose tea, coffee beans, and packaged chocolates have lower sales volumes, while lower-priced items like coffee and tea have high sales volumes. This presents an opportunity to optimize the sales of high-priced items through targeted promotions and product lineup adjustments.
Sales Trends: Sales peak during morning hours from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m., with a moderate level of activity from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Utilizing this information can help optimize staffing and marketing efforts throughout the day.
