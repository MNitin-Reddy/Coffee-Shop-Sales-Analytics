* __Product Popularity:__ Coffee is the most popular category, followed by tea and bakery items, suggesting a strong customer preference for these products.
* __Pricing and Sales Volume:__ Higher-priced items such as loose tea, coffee beans, and packaged chocolates have lower sales volumes, while lower-priced items like coffee and tea have high sales volumes. This presents an opportunity to optimize the sales of high-priced items through targeted promotions and product lineup adjustments.
